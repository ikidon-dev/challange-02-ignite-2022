# Challange 02 - Ignite 2022 (NodeJS)

This is the first challenge of Rocketseat's Ignite NodeJS 2022 trail and also one of the main challenges for completing the trail.

## Challenges I had

In this challenge I didn't have so many difficulties, I just had some problems when I tried to refactor some functions, but it was the famous "Comma of our day" lol.

## Start Project

Clone that GitHub repository on your machine with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikidon-dev/challange-02-ignite-2022.git
```

> It is recommended that you clone using an SSH key connected to your GitHub account.

Once cloned, just enter the project and download the dependencies using Yarn with the following commands

```bash
cd challange-02-ignite-2022.git && yarn
```

Finally, you can start the project and test it using Postman or Insomnia with the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Or if you want, you can just run Jest and see the result of the automated tests with the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```
